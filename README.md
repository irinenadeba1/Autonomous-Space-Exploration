# Decentralized Autonomous Space Exploration (DASE)

A blockchain-based platform enabling collaborative space exploration through decentralized mission management, resource sharing, and crowdfunding mechanisms.

## Overview

The Decentralized Autonomous Space Exploration (DASE) system creates a collaborative framework for space agencies, private companies, and individuals to participate in space exploration initiatives. The platform coordinates missions, manages resources, shares scientific data, and facilitates funding through smart contracts.

## Core Components

### 1. Mission Contract
- Manages space mission lifecycle:
    - Mission planning and objectives
    - Timeline management
    - Launch coordination
    - Success criteria
    - Risk assessment
- Features:
    - Mission versioning
    - Progress tracking
    - Contingency planning
    - Automated mission updates
    - Inter-mission dependencies

### 2. Resource Allocation Contract
- Coordinates shared space resources:
    - Satellite networks
    - Ground stations
    - Launch facilities
    - Computing resources
    - Equipment usage
- Implements:
    - Resource scheduling
    - Priority management
    - Conflict resolution
    - Usage tracking
    - Maintenance scheduling

### 3. Data Sharing Contract
- Facilitates scientific collaboration:
    - Research data storage
    - Discovery sharing
    - Data verification
    - Access control
    - Citation tracking
- Features:
    - Encrypted data storage
    - Peer review process
    - Data marketplace
    - Attribution system
    - Cross-mission analytics

### 4. Funding Contract
- Manages financial aspects:
    - Crowdfunding campaigns
    - Budget allocation
    - Expense tracking
    - Return distribution
    - Risk management
- Implements:
    - Multiple funding rounds
    - Milestone-based releases
    - Investment tracking
    - Profit sharing
    - Emergency funds
